Today I started the CAD for the robot. The plan going in was to maximize the size of the weapon while keeping everything as simple as possible. To accomplish this, I planned to use 3/8" UHMW frame rails, tangent drive, and an aluminum eggbeater driven by a custom hubmotor. The custom hubmotor eggbeater is the focus of this project and will be most if not all of what I will be purchasing with the grant from Hack Club.

Insert sketches and uprights

The first issue in my desing process occured when I realized that the aluminum inserts that prevent the holes for the weapon shaft in the frame rails from ovalling out would stick out past the frame rail on the other side. This is a simple remedy if you have access to a mill or lathe. All you need to do is face 0.094" off of the round side.
